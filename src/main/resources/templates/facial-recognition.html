    <h1>Facial Recognition</h1>
    <p>Facial recognition is a technology that identifies or verifies a person by analyzing patterns based on their facial features.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="how-it-works">
    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are looking at a friend's face. You recognize them because of their eyes, nose, mouth, and the position of these features. Facial recognition works in a similar way. It measures various features of a face and compares them to faces in a database to find a match.</p>
    <p>Machine Learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, makes facial recognition systems smarter over time. It helps these systems learn from every face they analyze, improving their accuracy.</p>

  <section id="demo">
    <h2>See It In Action!</h2>
    <p>Upload a photo and our system will analyze it to detect a face:</p>
    <form th:action="@{/detect-face}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="faceImage">
      <input type="submit" value="Detect Face">
    </form>
    <p th:if="${faceDetected != null}" th:text="${faceDetected ? 'A face was detected in the image!' : 'No face was detected. Please try another image.'}"></p>
