This can cause unnecessary alarm or leave vulnerabilities unchecked. An AI system may flag a regular network maintenance activity as a cybersecurity threat, causing disruption and requiring human verification to clear the false alarm.</p>

                <strong>Complexity and Management: </strong>
                <p>Implementing AI in cybersecurity requires expertise not just in security, but also in AI technology. This can be a challenge for organizations without the necessary resources.</p>
                <p>Example: Small businesses may struggle to implement AI-based security solutions due to a lack of in-house expertise or the resources to hire specialists or consultants.</p>

                <strong>Over-reliance and Complacency:  </strong>
                <p>There's a risk that relying too much on AI can lead to complacency, where humans might ignore or not recognize the importance of their role in the cybersecurity process.</p>
                <p>Example: A company may become too dependent on its AI system for security, not realizing that AI is best used as a tool to augment human decision-making, not replace it.</p>

        <h3 id="chapter1Sub5Sub3">1.5.3: Future Trends in AI for Cybersecurity</h3>
        <p>AI is expected to become more predictive and proactive. In the future, AI could anticipate and neutralize threats before they manifest, based on trends and data analysis. Cybersecurity firms are developing AI that can simulate potential future attacks based on current threat landscapes, allowing organizations to prepare defenses against attacks that haven't even been attempted yet.</p>

                <strong>Integration with IoT: </strong>
                <p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) grows, AI will be crucial in managing the security of countless interconnected devices.</p>
                <p>Example: AI could be used to monitor the behavior of smart home devices to detect and prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that someone's smart fridge or thermostat doesn't become a security vulnerability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Autonomous Response:  </strong>
                <p>AI systems will likely gain more autonomy in responding to threats, potentially taking action to mitigate risks without waiting for human approval.</p>
                <p>Example: In the future, an AI system could automatically isolate a part of a network if it detects behavior that strongly suggests a ransomware attack is underway, thereby containing the threat and preventing widespread damage.</p>
